Hello everyone, 

Today, I want to talk about the importance of protocols and statistical analysis plans in clinical trials, and why regulators are so important in my opinion. 

But first, I'll talk a bit about myself, the work that I do, about the replication crisis in psychology - and how this replication crisis relates to the importance of the protocol. 

So, about myself: Originally, I'm from Baselland. But I studied Psychology in Bern and did masters in cognitive psychology and research method. 

Then I did a master in statistics at ETH. 

I currently live in Bern and Work at Roche Basel as a data scientist.

::: notes
I have been working at Roche for about 2 years. 
For anyone who doesn't know, Roche is a giant pharmaceutical company with around 100 000 employees. 
I work in Pharma Product Development in the Data and Statistical sciences team. 
We are around 300 Data scientists, data managers and statisticians sharing three floors in one of the towers in Basel. 
I don't know exactly how many people work in our team globally, but quite a few more.

The main goal of our team is to generate evidence of whether a drug is efficacious and safe for treating specific diseases. 
The way we do that is by designing and evaluating clinical trials in close collaboration with clinical scientists, physicians, and patients. 
If a drug works as we intend, we must provide valid and reliable evidence to the regulators to be able to get the drug on the market.

The data science aspect of this involves many different tasks, and at Roche this is typically split across a team of data scientists. 
On a clinical trial team you would typically have at least one Biostatistician, one statistical programmer, and a data manager.

I was originally hired as a statistical programmer where I would program standarised data-sets, run analyses, and generate outputs for the clinical study report. 
Incidentally, the report would then be written by medical writers, another role. 

A biostatistician on the other hand would be more responsible for planning the trial, deciding on the right statistical analyses, and ensuring trial integrity from a statistical perspective. 

As I have a degree in statistics, I am now also involved in some projects as a statistician. 
So now I am in what we call a fluid role as both a statistician and statistical programmer, and I am also involved in some r package development projects.

## Replication crisis in Psychology

-   Researchers are unable to replicate many findings from psychological experiments.
    -   @klein2018 managed to replicate only 15 / 28 studies
    -   @opensciencecollaboration2015 replicated only 36 / 100 studies, with on average half of the original effect size
-   @yarkoni2022: How generalisable are findings from psychological experiments?

## Many labs result

![Results of @opensciencecollaboration2015](images/349_aac4716_fa.jpeg)

## Why? Misaligned incentives for researchers {.smaller}

-   Publication bias

    -   Harder and less likely to publish null-results

    -   More likely to continue looking for something

-   Questionable research practices undermine trial integrity

    -   Hypothesising After Results are Known (HARK-ing)

    -   P-Hacking

-   Fraud, for an example see Data Colada posts by @simonsohn2023

    -   Hard to spot, as open data is not very common

-   Doing replications is not "novel research", less prestigious

## Realign researcher incentives

**Move away from rewarding the most headline-grabbing findings**

-   Preregistration, see [OSF](https://osf.io/)
    -   Support trial integrity / validity
    -   Preregistered reports almost guarantee publication before data collection
    -   Published based on the merits of the hypothesis and methods, independent of results
-   Open research
    -   Openly available data and methods
        -   Encourage collaboration
        -   Reduce ease of fraud
    -   Openly available publications
-   Data as publication rewards data collection
    -   Increases data quality
    -   Treated as legitimate research

## Things are changing

Structural changes are happening

<!-- | Many psychological effects experiments have failed \| -->
<!-- | maybe talk about baserate problem. e.g. if you have 1000 hypothesis and they have 10% chance of being true, then you would find 80 studies to be truly positive (80% power), but would 900 \* alpha% = 45 be falsely true out of 100 studies @klein2018 \| -->
<!-- | \## Ways to fix this \| -->
<!-- | - Preregistration, see OSF - Set different incentives, Publish based on the merits of the methods and the interesting research question, not on the results - Journals should publish \| -->

## Protocol - Study blueprint

- Includes:
  - Motivation and objectives
  - Primary and key secondary endpoints, as estimands
  - Methodology
  - Organisation
  - Some statistical considerations, e.g. sample size & power, etc. 

- Details should allow recreation of the study

## Estimands

An **estimand** is a precise description of the treatment effect to be estimated in a clinical trial. 
- "What exactly do we want to learn from the trial?"

- **Key Attributes:**
  - **Population:** The specific group of patients of interest.
  - **Treatment:** The intervention or comparison of interest.
  - **Outcome:** The specific outcome variable being measured.
  - **Intercurrent Events:** Events that occur after treatment initiation that affect the interpretation of the outcome (e.g., use of rescue medication, treatment discontinuation).
  - **Population-level Summary:** The summary measure that will be used to quantify the treatment effect (e.g., difference in means, hazard ratio).

## Statistical analysis plan

- Describes the precise statistical analysis for each estimand. 
- Written before looking at the data
- Confirmatory analysis with less researchers degree of freedom
- Exploratory analysis still encouraged, but must be declared as such
